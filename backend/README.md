# 🏥 Medical AI Search Platform - Backend Services

Welcome to the **complete learning guide** for our Medical AI Search Platform! This guide will teach you everything about building a production-ready medical document search system from scratch.

## 🎯 What Are We Building?

Think of **Google for medical documents**, but much smarter! Our platform helps doctors, researchers, and medical students find exactly the medical information they need in seconds.

### Real-World Impact:
```
👩‍⚕️ Emergency Doctor: "Patient has chest pain + diabetes. Need treatment protocols NOW!"
🔍 Our Platform: "Found 234 relevant protocols in 0.3 seconds, filtered for diabetic patients"
👩‍⚕️ Doctor: "Perfect! Patient saved with informed decision."
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture (The Big Picture)

```
👤 Users → 🔐 Authentication → 📄 Document Upload → 🤖 AI Processing → 🔍 Search Index → ⚡ Instant Search
```

### Our Microservices:

| Service | What It Does | Think Of It As |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 🔐 **Authentication** | User login, permissions, security | Hospital security guard |
| 📄 **Document Management** | Upload, store, organize files | Smart filing system |
| 🤖 **Content Processing** | AI analysis, extract medical terms | Super-smart medical librarian |
| 🔍 **Search Indexing** | Make documents searchable | Organize everything for instant finding |
| 🔎 **Search API** | Find documents lightning-fast | Google for medical documents |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Get Everything Running in 10 Minutes)

### Prerequisites:
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (our deployment system)
- **8GB RAM minimum** (for AI models and search engine)
- **Basic terminal knowledge** (copy-paste commands)

### Step 1: Clone and Start
```bash
# Get the code
git clone <repository-url>
cd medical-ai-search/backend

# Start everything (this might take 5-10 minutes first time)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Wait for services to start
sleep 60

# Check if everything is running
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

### Step 2: Create Your First User
```bash
# Register as a doctor
curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "doctor@hospital.com",
    "username": "dr_smith",
    "password": "SecurePass123!",
    "first_name": "Dr. John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "role": "doctor"
  }'

# Login and get your access token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8010/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "doctor@hospital.com", "password": "SecurePass123!"}' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

echo "Your access token: $TOKEN"
```

### Step 3: Upload Your First Medical Document
```bash
# Upload a PDF (replace with your actual PDF file)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8011/api/v1/documents/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@your_medical_document.pdf" \
  -F "title=My First Medical Document" \
  -F "authors=Dr. Smith" \
  -F "document_type=research_paper"
```

### Step 4: Watch the AI Magic Happen
```bash
# Check processing status (AI is reading your document)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8013/api/v1/processing/jobs"

# Wait a minute, then check indexing (making it searchable)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8014/api/v1/indexing/jobs"
```

### Step 5: Search Your Document!
```bash
# Search for your document
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8015/api/v1/search/?q=medical&size=5"
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You now have a fully functional medical AI search platform!
